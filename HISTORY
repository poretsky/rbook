rbook 2.0

2010-02-17  Igor B. Poretsky <poretsky@mlbox.ru>

	* Fixed relationship with Emacspeak. Rbook happily coexists with
	  Emacspeak, but does not require it in any aspect.

2010-02-16  Igor B. Poretsky <poretsky@mlbox.ru>

	* Adjust volume on the resampling stage to avoid possible
	  distortion.

	* Strict and elaborate mp3 bitrate customization. Variable bitrate
	  can be used now as well as the fixed ones.

	* Default to the ru_tts native sampling frequency.

	* Comments revision.

	* Recode Lame input into the wav format.

2010-02-15  Igor B. Poretsky <poretsky@mlbox.ru>

	* Restored volume control when reading that was broken by switching
	  to aplay.

	* Removed trivial script for playing sound icons. The aplay program
	  is called from the elisp module instead.

	* All Russian stuff recoded to utf8. Improved customization
	  mechanism for rbook-pronunciation dictionary and
	  rbook-collect-unknown-words.


rbook 1.3.4

2009-04-11  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Separate last read bookmark from rbook-default-bookmark.
	We shouldn't keep changing value in customizable option.

2009-04-11  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Ensure that bookmarks are loaded before calling rbook-read-from-bookmark


rbook 1.3.3

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Rename rbook-read-bookmark to rbook-read-from-bookmark

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Rename rbook-read-text to rbook-read-here

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Check whether output file/directory exists and is writable

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Simplify interactive behavior of rbook-make-audio-book

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Rewrite a bit documentation strings.

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Change speak and mp3 scripts to work with normal lame.
	Previously lame-ha was required in order to handle output of ru_tts
	without external resampling programs. Now SoX is used to resample
	sound stream from 10 kHz to 16 kHz.

2009-04-10  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Added coding cookie to rbook.el


rbook 1.3.2

2009-04-08  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Fix interactive form in rbook-read-bookmark.
	Earlier bookmark-completing-read used to return list with bookmark,
	but now it returns only bookmark itself.

2009-04-08  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Don't mention sox in README.txt

2009-04-07  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduchikh@gmail.com>

	Use aplay instead of sox for playing

2009-03-14  Igor B. Poretsky <poretsky@mlbox.ru>

	* Fixed element type for chapter header pattern.


rbook 1.3.1

2008-08-24  Dmitri Paduchikh  <dpaduch@k66.ru>

	* Changed version number to 1.3.1.

	* Made changes to installation instructions in README.txt.

	* Do not depend on hard-coded file names, instead initialize file
	names using directory from which rbook was loaded.

	* In rbook.el use coding system cyrillic-koi8 explicitly when
	reading text. Make rbook-exchange-buffer, the buffer for processes
	communication, an unibyte buffer. When communicating with
	subprocesses while encoding use binary coding system rather than
	raw-text.

	* Added customizable variable rbook-pronunciation-dictionary so
	that one can easily change location of stress dictionary used by
	the script.

	* Changed scripts speak and play in order to play sound through
	ALSA rather than OSS. Also use command-line options -1 and -2 of
	sox because sox 14 doesn't accept -b and -w anymore.
