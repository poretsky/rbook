;; The rbook package follows the Debian/GNU Linux 'emacsen' policy and
;; byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs flavor' (emacs19,
;; xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled code is then
;; installed in a subdirectory of the respective site-lisp directory.
;; We have to add this to the load-path:
(let ((package-dir (concat "/usr/share/"
                           (symbol-name flavor)
                           "/site-lisp/rbook")))
  ;; If package-dir does not exist, the rbook package must have
  ;; removed but not purged, and we should skip the setup.
